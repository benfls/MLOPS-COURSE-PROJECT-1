# Reservation Prediction Project

## Description
This project is focused on building a machine learning model to predict reservations. It is part of the Beginner to Advanced MLOps training program. The goal is to develop a robust pipeline that processes data, trains a model, and evaluates its performance.

The project leverages several cutting-edge technologies to ensure scalability, reproducibility, and efficiency:
- **Docker** is used to containerize the application, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **Jenkins** is integrated to implement a CI/CD pipeline, automating the process of testing, building, and deploying the application.
- **GitHub** serves as the version control system, enabling collaborative development and seamless integration with Jenkins for automated workflows.
- **MLflow** is utilized to track experiments, monitor model training, and manage model versions, providing insights into the performance of different training runs.

The deployment pipeline ensures that the trained model can be seamlessly transitioned from development to production, with automated testing and monitoring in place to maintain reliability and performance.

## Project Structure
- **artifacts/**: Contains raw and processed datasets and saved machine learning models..
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and prototyping.
- **src/**: Source code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- **pipeline**: For python main file to execute all step.
- **templates**: HTML file of th UI.
- **static**: CSS code pour style of UI.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning.
- Evaluation of model performance.
- Deployment-ready pipeline.

## Technologies Used
- **Docker**: Containerization of the application for consistent environments.
- **Jenkins**: Continuous integration and deployment pipeline.
